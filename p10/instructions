This program supports creation, altering, and drawing of Bezier curves.

BASIC IMPLEMENTATION: 60 POINTS:
Implement a Point2 class, that holds a 2D point comprised of 2 floats.
Implement a Bezier class, that consists of and array of 4 Point2 objects.
The Bezier class should have these methods:
Point2 Evaluate(float t); // given parameter t between 0 and 1, finds the interpolated point.
void DrawCurve(); // draws the curve by approximating it at about 20 evaluation points.
void DrawControlPoints(); // draws the 4 control points as circles.
The screen starts with 1 Bezier curve, in some default position.
Your display method should call DrawCurve and DrawControlPoints
This is the formula for evaluating a Bezier curve:
p= p0*(1-t)*(1-t)*(1-t) + 3*p1*(1-t)*(1-t)*t + 3*p2*(1-t)*t*t + p3*t*t*t;
 
·         STEP 2: 20 POINTS:

·         Allow the user to move the control points around.

·         When the mouse goes down, see if its on a control point.

·         If it is, allow the mouse to drag that point, until the mouse button is released.

·         Of course, the curve should dynamically update as its control points are altered.

·         You should add this method to your Bezier class:

·         int IsPicked(float x,float y);

·         // returns <n> if x,y is within <radius> of control point <n>.

·         // returns -1 if x,y is not close to any of the 4 control points.

·         You will also need to implement the GLUT callback function:

·         glutMotionFunc(motion);

·         which is prototyped as follows:

·         void motion(int x, int y); // gets called during a mouse drag.

·          

·         Step 3: 10 POINTS:

·         Provide a menu option to add more Bezier curves, up to 5.

·         These should be placed nicely, so that they are not on top of previous ones.

·         The control points of all the curves should be alterable.

·          

·         Step 4: 10 POINTS:

·         Provide some user interface (your design) which allows the user to individually color all of the curves.

·         For example, you may have the keys (1-5) select a curve to be "active". Then a menu option with various colors could set the color of the "active" curve.
